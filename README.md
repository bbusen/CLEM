# CLEM
C***** Little Earth Model

The purpose of CLEM is to have a toy earth model that is simple enough for anyone to use, trading accuracy for versatility and ease of use.  Instead of predicting a 3.5 degree temperature rise over the next century, you can move the earth out farther from the sun, tilt it differently, add industry, ice, and other things, and watch a variety of things change over timescales selectable by the user.
